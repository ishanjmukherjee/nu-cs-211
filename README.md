Materials for Northwestern University's course [CS 211: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I, Winter 2024](https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4930/MEAS/COMP_SCI/24645).

I received a perfect score on every project and homework (except the occasional late penalty or missing header comment).
