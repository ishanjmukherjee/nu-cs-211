Materials for Northwestern University's course [CS 211: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I, Winter 2024](https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4930/MEAS/COMP_SCI/24645).

I received a perfect score on every project and homework (except the occasional late penalty or the missing header comment). I received a perfect _total_ score on projects, though, because I made up for the penalties with my extra credit project scores (perfect 50/50 followed by 10/50). 

I got a 96/100 on the final. The mean was 85.97, the median was 90, the upper quartile was 95, and the highest score was 100.

Lecture 15 isn't missing; Prof Hummel skipped it because he was out of town.
